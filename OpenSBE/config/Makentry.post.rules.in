# These rules keep make from trying to use the match-anything rule below to
# rebuild the makefiles--ouch!  Obviously, if you don't follow my convention
# of using a `.mk' suffix on all non-standard makefiles you'll need to change
# the pattern rule.

Makefile : ;
%.mk :: ;

# Anything we don't know how to build will use this rule.  The command is a
